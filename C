# review-manager — Check, draft, and post Google reviews

## DESCRIPTION
This skill manages Google reviews for Alpha Tours Rome. It uses the **NEW Places API v1** (`places.googleapis.com`) — **no OAuth needed**, just a simple API key.

## IMPORTANT UPDATE (May 6, 2026)
**BREAKTHROUGH:** The NEW Places API v1 now works for Alpha Tours Rome! Previously we thought Places API didn't work because Alpha Tours is a service-area business. But the **New Places API** (with `AIzaSyBp0MQ_nXd6zhs6z9CU172Ua7q5FSzfBIg`) returns full review data including:
- ✅ 5 most recent reviews with full text
- ✅ Author names, ratings, timestamps
- ✅ Unique review IDs (for deduplication)
- ✅ Author profile photos and URIs
- ❌ Still only 5 reviews (Google limit), and still no API for POSTING replies
- ❌ No pagination support — cannot fetch all 23 via API in one go
- ❌ No `reply` field in API response data
- ❌ Old Places API (`maps.googleapis.com`) does NOT work (Place ID migrated)
- ❌ Text Search returns ZERO_RESULTS (service-area business)

**Key URL:** `https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places/ChIJHcAuWLqLJRMR-nD81t9OlAk`
**Headers:** `X-Goog-Api-Key`, `X-Goog-FieldMask`, `X-Goog-Language`

## STRATEGY: 2-Layer System

### Layer 1 🟢 NEW Places API v1 — PRIMARY
`node tools/review-manager.mjs`
- No OAuth, no rate limits hitting us
- Fetches 5 most recent reviews instantly
- Generates brand-voice draft replies
- Tracks seen reviews in `tools/seen-reviews.json`

### Layer 2 🟡 Manual Posting + Cumulative Archive
- Google Places API does NOT support posting replies (only My Business API does)
- CEO must copy/paste drafts into `business.google.com`
- The `approve` command outputs ready-to-paste content
- **NEW:** Cumulative archive (`all-reviews.json`) tracks ALL reviews ever seen (builds up over time as `fetch` is run repeatedly)
- **NEW:** Reply tracking (`replied-reviews.json`) lets you mark which reviews have been responded to

## WORKFLOW

### Step 1 — Fetch New Reviews
Run: `node tools/review-manager.mjs fetch`

This will:
1. Call NEW Places API v1
2. Compare review IDs with `tools/seen-reviews.json`
3. Show new (unseen) reviews
4. Save to `tools/new-reviews.json`
5. **Append to cumulative archive** (`tools/all-reviews.json`) — every fetch adds any new unique reviews

### Step 2 — Generate Draft Replies
Run: `node tools/review-manager.mjs draft`

This will:
1. Read `tools/new-reviews.json`
2. For each new review, generate a brand-voice draft reply
3. Save to `tools/pending-drafts.json`

### Step 3 — Review & Approve
Run: `node tools/review-manager.mjs show` → to see all pending drafts

Run: `node tools/review-manager.mjs approve` → to:
1. Mark all drafted review IDs as seen
2. Clear drafts and new reviews
3. **Output ready-to-copy replies** for manual posting on Google Business Profile

### Step 4 — Post Manually
1. CEO logs into `business.google.com`
2. Goes to Reviews section
3. For each review, clicks "Reply" and pastes the draft

### Step 5 — Track Replies
After posting on business.google.com, run:
`node tools/review-manager.mjs replied --all`

This marks all reviews in the archive as replied (for tracking purposes).

## DATA FILES

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tools/seen-reviews.json` | Set of review IDs already processed |
| `tools/new-reviews.json` | Newly fetched reviews not yet drafted |
| `tools/pending-drafts.json` | Draft replies ready for approval |
| `tools/all-reviews.json` | **Cumulative archive** — all reviews ever seen (builds up over time) |
| `tools/replied-reviews.json` | Set of review IDs that have replies posted |

## TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `API Error: blocked` | Key1 doesn't have Places API enabled | Key2 (`AIzaSyBp0MQ_nXd6zhs6z9CU172Ua7q5FSzfBIg`) works |
| `No new reviews` | All API reviews already seen | Normal — means no recent new reviews |
| Draft wrong tour type | Text matching false-positive | Edit `draftReply` in `pending-drafts.json` before approve |
| API returns only 5 reviews | Google limit for non-OAuth | Acceptable — 5 is enough for weekly checks; cumulative archive builds over time |
| Can't see all 23 reviews | API pagination not available | Use `list` to see cumulative archive; run `fetch` regularly to accumulate |
| `TODO LIST in review` | Review mentions TODO list | Manual edit may be needed |
